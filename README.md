Unitys 3D Alien Shooter Tutorial

This is not mine.  It was pratice code I wrote for Unity's tutorial: https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/survival-shooter-tutorial

I thought it would be neat to see if I can port this over to HTC Vive VR.  It should be cool to see the room from a "mouse size" perspective.
